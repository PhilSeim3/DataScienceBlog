Udacity Data science blog post project files

## Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to present my workings for the Udacity Data Science Nano degree Data Blog Assignment.
The source of the data for these files were from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

I wanted to take a look at what factors cause people to respond as being happy. The happiness survey presents a few metrics and shows how these metrics influence the happiness score. By Analysing the data I wanted to see if factors influencing happiness stay constant through time as well as look at the size of impact. Can happiness be predicted and what do people need in order to be happy. 

I've looked at the dataset overall but an interesting hypothesis to look at further could be seperating this data by GDP, as it appears at lower income Generosity is a major factor but in higher income countries it appear to be GDP per capita.
